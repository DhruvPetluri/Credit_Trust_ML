Background
A person’s creditworthiness is often associated (conversely) with the likelihood they may default on loans.

We’re giving you anonymized data on about 1000 loan applications, along with a certain set of attributes about the applicant itself, and whether they were considered high risk.

0 = Low credit risk i.e high chance of paying back the loan amount

1 = High credit risk i.e low chance of paying back the loan amount
